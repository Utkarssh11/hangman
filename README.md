C++ Hangman App
This is a console-based game where the player is challenged to guess a secret word or phrase by suggesting letters one at a time.

How to Play
At the start of the game, a random word or phrase is selected from a pre-determined list of options. The player begins guessing letters by inputting them through the console. If the guessed letter is present in the secret word, the app updates the template to reveal all occurrences of the letter in the correct positions. If the guessed letter is not present in the word, the app will subtract one from the player's total number of guesses remaining.

The player must keep guessing letters until they either correctly guess the word or phrase or run out of guesses. If they fail to guess the word or phrase, the app will display the full word or phrase and the player will lose. If the player correctly guesses the word or phrase within the allotted number of guesses, they win.
